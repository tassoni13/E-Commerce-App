  ## Description
  This is an excercise on building the back-end of an e-commerce application that utilizes NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL, and Sequelize to host and route data. Using a testing tool such as Insomnia or Postman we can test the functionality of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for the three databases we will be using: products, categories, and tags.
